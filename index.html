            <h1 id ="web">Web Typography: Proportion & practicality, rhythm & flow</h1>

                    <p class="back">Ink and blood run thick in the streets when typographers debate typographic scale. Much of both have been spilled fighting for — and extolling the virtues of — the one perfect ratio between paragraphs and larger typographic elements (whichever ‘one’ that is). From Bringhurst to Brown, there are countless attempts to define exactly how type should scale from one size to another. The underlying goal is harmony in the design system: attempting to create meaningful relationships between elements.</p>
        
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Fibonacci_spiral_34.svg/250px-Fibonacci_spiral_34.svg.png" >
        
        <p class="back">The theory being that the scale connects headings and text together in a way similar to how nature has evolved proportions between human features, butterfly wings and their patterns, the shell of a nautilus, the list goes on. And in a perfectly composed printed page, that may well work in beautiful fashion.
</p>

            <h2 class="back">Trouble is, they don’t work on today’s web</h2>
            
                <p class="back">Here’s the thing about modular scales: they’re only designed to work at one size layout. Change the paper size, change the scale. That’s because the hierarchy is based around those very specific parameters.</p>

            <p class="back">If one is to strip back the specifics and look at the ‘why’, we discover this is about information hierarchy. The main heading is the most important piece of text on the page, and therefore is set with the greatest emphasis (which usually means it’s the largest). Secondary headings are less important, but more so than the body. Captions on photos might be considered the least important of these elements, and are therefore often set a little smaller.</p>

                <p class="back">Notice that I’ve described the hierarchy <em>without ever mentions a point or a pixel</em></p>

                    <p class="back">These days there are thousands of different screen sizes and resolutions in use on the web. There is simply no way to know what the screen size or window width will be when someone visits your site. Different purposes and different screen sizes require different proportions. The main heading is still the most important, the secondary headings are still next — but the specific sizes need to change.</p>

            <p class="back">Having a heading three times the size of the body looks comical on a phone, and almost certainly will break in very awkward ways. I’ve seen entire phone screens covered with a headline fitting one word per line — or worse, breaking that single word across two lines one or two letters at a time regardless of hyphenation settings.</p>

<h2 class="back">Scaling the scale</h2>

        <p class="back">The answer is simple: the scale has to scale. I first started writing and speaking about this back in 2012, and covered it fairly extensively in a post on the (now defunct) Typecast blog and in my book, Responsive Typography. But the simple gist of it is that on small screens you can be more subtle, since there are fewer distractions and elements that need to be distinguished at any given time.</p>

            <p class="back">So an example might be that a main heading might be two times the size of the body copy on the smallest screens, two and a half times on medium size screens, and three times body copy on a large screen device. You could certainly try to keep to the values found in a perfectly <strong>harmonic modular</strong> scale, but it feels a bit forced.</p>

                <p class="back">I tend to look at a few different size headings and body copy together on various screen sizes and adjust them based on screen ranges. One set of proportions for the smallest screens, and another for the largest ones. Then I’ll fine-tune them in between to maintain the hierarchy I’m looking for. It’s not scientific, but it’s clear to the reader on any device.</p>

                    <p class="back">The important takeaway is that it’s not about the pixels; it’s about proportion. Your design has to convey information, and the structure of that information is conveyed by the scale relationships between elements (and of course is built upon the semantic HTML elements used in the first place)</p>
        
        <h2 class="back">Vertically rhythmic</h2>
        
            <p class="back">If you haven’t had enough bloodshed for one email, try looking up debates about baseline grids and vertical rhythm on the web (lots of references on this one). After you’ve had your fill, I’ll give you my personal take.</p>
        
        <h2 class="back">Going with the flow</h2>
        
            <p class="back">his is one of the most important truths of web typography as a differentiator from its paper-based counterpart: some things you just can’t control — so don’t try. Lean into the fluidity and look for ways to embrace it. Use the techniques that translate. And keep experimenting. I’ve been working through some new ideas over the past year that take the ‘scaling scale’ even further. If you end up seeing one of my talks this year you’ll learn more about it — and I’ll certainly be writing more about it here.</p>
        
            <p class="back">It’s a bit more complex, so I may hold off for a little bit until I cover a few more of the basics. But pairing these techniques with the fundamentals of the paragraph that I covered a few weeks ago will give you a solid foundation for your typographic system. Have fun, and don’t forget to share what you learn! I’d love to hear about it.</p>

<h1 id="ui-design">9 important fundamentals of UI design I didn’t know about</h1>
        
        <h4><a href = "https://uxplanet.org/@xtabbas"> T.Abbas Khan</a><br>
            May 3| 5min read </h4>
            
            <p>After listening to Craig Federighi’s talk on how to be a better software engineer I was sold on the idea that it is super important for a software engineer to learn the basic principles of software design.</p>
            
            <p>For this reason, I embarked upon a journey to cross my lane and learn design and user experience and open myself to new ideas and possibilities. While I am nowhere near the journey’s end, I did manage to pick some fundamentals along the way for UI design that will help me for the days to come.</p>
            
            <p>In this article, I will recap and mention these fundamentals and what I learned while working on a new UI design project in Figma. A web based, massively collaborative and easy to use design tool.</p>
            
            <p>In conclusion, this article points to the importance of maintaining a design system for UI development for any project, big or small. A design system keeps you as a designer sane when it’s easy to get lost in your creative ideas</p>
            
            <img src ="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Mattermost_UI.png" width="500">
            
            <h2>Consistency requires work</h2>
            
            <p>If there is only one rule for designing interfaces it is consistency. Consistency is essential not only for your design to look and feel good but also because it encourages stability and fluidness between development and design teams.</p>
            
            <p>As a designer you’ve heard of this before. I surely did, but what I didn’t know was that consistency requires work. It is easy to be inconsistent and move fast. However, being consistent is essential for a design to be successful.</p>
            
<p>For example, if you are using 16pts padding for your modals then you must use it with every other modal in your design. Similarly, your colors, paddings, alignments, typography, shadows and assets need to be consistent throughout.</p>

<h2>Don’t go off the grid!</h2>

<p>Before jumping on your creative wagon and producing the best designs of your life, consider investing in a grid system. Grids are great because they enforce a consistent design across the team. As individuals they help you iterate much faster as the grid allows you to snap UI elements in the right position.</p>
<p>Make grids an integral part of your design system. On the web a 10pts grid is often used. On mobile platforms 8pts grid works like a charm.</p>

<h2>Determine font sizes</h2>
<p>Now every time and again, you will need a headline text or a caption text which is smaller than normal. So decide all of your fonts before moving on to building your prototype. You will save a lot of time and ensure consistency. Your colleagues will rejoice in you and your future self will be very pleased.</p>

<h2>Avoid small body text</h2>
<p>Have you ever seen a mobile app with fonts that you can’t read? That is absolutely a no go. A rule of thumb is to use at least 16 points for your body text on mobile designs. A readable text goes a long way as there are people who struggle to see smaller fonts.</p>

<h2>Contrast is super important</h2>

<p>If you have dark themes darken the distant surfaces. Farther in the distance they are the darker they get. Do not only invert your light theme. Think from a light source perspective. Also, avoid pure black or white. Lookup black smearing.</p>

<p>Contrast and accessibility goes hand in hand. Think about the difference of colors of the background layer and the text layer. Contrast ratio 7? Way to go! Contrast ratio 3.9? Not good.</p>

<h2>Avoid pure white text on dark background</h2>
<p>Pure white on pure dark is the highest contrast possible 21:1 which may sound good in theory, but it can cause eye fatigue and halation. Avoid pure white text. Go with 90% opacity with your whites on a darker background which gets easier to read.</p>

<p>There are many other tips and tricks to better your UI design and process. For now, I could only muster a few of them to share with you people. Hopefully you have taken something valuable from this article.</p>
